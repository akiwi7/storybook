No cow in the kitchen.  
No goat on the table.  
No pig in the cupboard.  
No chickens underfoot.  
Just Father, Mother, six children, the dog, and the cat—  
all with room to sit, to eat, to sleep, and to smile.  

Father called the wise man and said,  
“With the animals back in the barn, our house feels so quiet and clean.  
And best of all, it feels so very spacious!  
I'd give anything to be as clever as you are!”  
And everyone in the tiny little house laughed together,  
for it no longer felt so tiny at all. </div>
